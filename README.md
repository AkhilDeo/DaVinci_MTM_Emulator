# DaVinci_MTM_Emulator

An iPhone app designed to emulate the Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) of a Da Vinci Surgical Robot. 
The final iPhone app will be able to control a simulation of a Da Vinci Surgical Robot, specifically 2 Patient Side Manipulators (PSMs). The python client controlling the simulation can be found [here](https://github.com/AkhilDeo/Simulation-Control).
